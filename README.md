# MVP

The project is to design a educational and informative application. In this case our app will render a globe in React and detail it with up-to-date information about various crisis/disasters.

The project must:

- Query an API to recieve up-to-date information
- Display that information on a map/globe
- Be informative, intutive and interactive
- Be suitable for a wide range of ages
- Should be able to provide drill-down granular detail

# Final Product

The project has delivered on the MVP with a number of additional features. The Crisis Mapper App delivers all the above points, and adds further Media Objects (informational videos) and multiple APIs.
